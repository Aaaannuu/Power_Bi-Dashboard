# HR-attrition-data-analysis(Interactive dashboard creation using Power_Bi) 
## Project Objective
To understand employee attrition, HR will use a Power BI dashboard. This will analyze age, salary, job satisfaction, role, and department to pinpoint areas for improvement.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Aaaannuu/Power_Bi-Dashboard/blob/main/HR_Analytics.csv"> Dataset

## KPI 
- Calculate the overall employee attrition rate.
- Identify the list of employees who have left the company.
- Analyze attrition rates by employee age group.
- Analyze the relationship between salary and attrition.
- Assess the correlation between job satisfaction and attrition.
- Determine attrition rates based on years of service.
- Analyze the attrition based on the department.

## Process
- Data Preparation (ETL): Cleanse and transform the HR dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.
- Visualization Development: Create interactive Power BI visuals to analyze attrition trends based on age, salary, job satisfaction, role, and department.
- Insight Generation: Analyze the visualizations to identify key drivers of employee attrition.
- Strategic Recommendation: Formulate actionable retention strategies based on the identified attrition drivers.

## Project Insights
- Male employees exhibit a higher attrition rate than female employees.
- Employees with salaries upto-5k demonstrate a higher propensity for early departure.
- Attrition is concentrated within the 26-35 age demographic.
- A 38% attrition rate is observed among employees with life science degrees.
- High attrition is observed within the Research and Development department, particularly in laboratory positions.
- Employees with one year of tenure show a higher likelihood of early departure.

## Conculsion
More men than women leave the company, and people with low pay, those in their late 20s and early 30s, and folks in the lab in research and development leave more often. Also, if they studied life science or have only been here a year, they are more likely to go. This shows we need to focus on keeping these groups of employees.
